# odin-recipes
This is a really basic HTML recipe website, that I will create following TOP (The Odin Project) foundations curriculum


By the end of this little project I hope to learn and put into practice the basic and main HTML coding stuff, while also learning about Git and Github stuff at the same time

Added CSS styling after The Odin Project Assignment
